<h1>About</h1>
<p align="justify"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Cancer is a genetic disease caused by mutations in a group of genes,which belong to specific signaling pathways. A cancer specific path-way is highly activated in only one single cancer while having low activation in other cancers. Understanding cancer specific pathways play an important role to discover efficient remedy for malignancies. Although several studies have been proposed to identify cancer specific pathways, they investigate signaling pathways related to cancers without considering the effect of drugs.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Results:</strong> This study introduces pathway activation score and apply it to propose a systematic method to identify cancer-specific pathways that mediate the action of drugs. Our analysis provides cancer specific pathways of 23 different cancers discovered in GDSC cohort and validated in TCGA along with false discover rate (FDR) control. We further investigate the relation between cancer specific pathway sand drug response, which mainly focus on acute myeloid leukemia(AML) - most common acute leukemia in adults. From specific pathways identified by our analysis, we find out 28 pathways strongly correlating to drug response, which archive the significant rediscovery rate (RDR) in two independent cohorts including GDSC and BeatAML.</p>
